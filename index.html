            <p class="align">For all of our programs in Bangladesh, we will locate villages and towns in need via our
                Board members
                and volunteers living in the areas. We will approach these communities and ask if they would be
                interested in working with us. We will then explain our programs and allow them to select what their
                community most needs. The corporation’s activities will focus on the teachings of our Lord, Jesus
                Christ, to feed the needy children of Africa regardless of their country of origin, and to provide
                shelter and food for the homeless children based on the Christian teaching. We will maintain and
                establish a safe environment for needy children, and provide ongoing basic healthcare needs including
                clothing and food. We will work with local health clinics and hospitals in Nigeria, the Ivory Coast,
                Ghana, Kenya, and the Benin Republic to help distribute vaccinations.</p>
